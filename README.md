# First Year Project - ITU 2021
# Project 4 - Natural Language Processing
## Group 3

## Project Goals
In this project, we will learn how to work with natural language data. We will learn:

• What makes natural language different from other types of data

• How to prepare text data for automatic processing

• How to annotate data for supervised classification

• How to train and run a classifier for a basic NLP task

## Project Code
In this project we will work with Python, and jupyter notebook.

## Data
We use the TweetEval repository, a collection of 7 datasets for different classification tasks
based on social media post. The repository can be found here:
https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval.git

Each dataset is presented in the same format and with fixed training, validation and test splits.

## This project will focus on two tasks:
• **Binary Classification Task**: 
Classifying Speech as either "Hateful" or "Not Hateful"

• **Multiclass Classification Task**:
Predicting Emojis
